**Inspiration:**

The inspiration behind ConvChemy stems from our passion for both gaming and science. We wanted to create an immersive experience that not only entertained players but also challenged their intellect. Drawing from the concept of alchemy, ConvChemy allows players to engage in a competitive yet collaborative pursuit of creating the most elements within a set time limit. 

**Overview:**

ConvChemy is the ultimate alchemy-based game where players can challenge their friends to create the most elements within a designated time frame. Built using Convex, a powerful backend-as-a-service platform, ConvChemy offers lightning-fast updates through queries and mutations, eliminating the need for a separate WebSocket. Coupled with React and Tailwind, we've crafted an immersive and engaging gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of innovation.

**Tech Stack:**

- Backend: Convex
- Frontend: React & Tailwind

**How we built it:**

ConvChemy was developed with a focus on creating an intuitive and addictive gameplay experience. Players can easily create a room and invite friends to join, kicking off the competition once everyone is assembled. With Convex facilitating real-time updates, players can seamlessly combine elements to create unique compounds within the time limit, striving to outdo their opponents.

**Convex in Action:**

Convex serves as the backbone of ConvChemy, enabling lightning-fast updates and ensuring a smooth gaming experience. By eliminating the need for a separate WebSocket, Convex keeps players in sync with the latest game state, allowing for seamless interactions and real-time collaboration.

**Challenges we ran into:**

During the development of ConvChemy, we encountered several challenges that pushed our problem-solving skills to the limit. One notable obstacle was working with draggable elements in React, which proved to be more complex than anticipated. Implementing smooth and responsive drag-and-drop functionality required careful consideration of state management and event handling.
Additionally, integrating the GPT API to provide results in a specified format posed another significant challenge. Tuning the API to meet our requirements while maintaining optimal performance demanded considerable effort and experimentation. Despite these challenges, our team persevered, leveraging collaborative problem-solving and continuous iteration to overcome obstacles and deliver a polished gaming experience.

**What we learned:**

Through the development of ConvChemy, we gained insights into the intricacies of real-time gaming and the importance of leveraging advanced backend technologies like Convex to enhance player experiences. We also learned the significance of balancing competition with collaboration to foster an inclusive gaming environment.

**Whatâ€™s next for ConvChemy:**

Looking ahead, we plan to introduce new features to further enhance the ConvChemy experience. One such feature is a round-robin mode, where players take turns choosing an element, and the first to reach the specified compound wins the game. Additionally, we aim to continually iterate and improve ConvChemy based on player feedback and emerging trends in gaming technology.
